# hakathon-hiphop-tribute
In just 24 hours, our team of four passionate full-stack developers embarked on an exhilarating journey to create a compelling Hip-Hop Tribute project for the Super Bowl event. Armed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we seamlessly blended creativity and technical prowess to honor the hip-hop culture.

Employing the agile Scrum methodology, we navigated the challenges with enthusiasm, each member contributing their expertise in a synchronized dance of coding. The process was both fun and demanding, pushing us to the limits as we powered through with little sleep.

In the end, our dedication paid off, and we emerged victorious, clinching the top spot in the competition. This project not only showcased our technical skills but also underscored our ability to collaborate effectively under pressure. The Super Bowl Hackathon was not just an event; it was an unforgettable fusion of passion, innovation, and sleep-deprivation that resulted in a winning tribute to hip-hop. üèÜüé§
